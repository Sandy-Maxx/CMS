### Comprehensive List of Auto-Populated Placeholders

These placeholders can be embedded directly into your Word `.docx` letter templates. When a document is generated for a specific "Work" and "Firm" (if applicable) using the `AutodocGen` feature, the application will automatically replace these placeholders with the corresponding data from your database.

**How to Use:**

*   **For `AutodocGen` (Letters/Office Notes):** When generating documents from the "Works" tab (right-click context menu), these `[]` and `<<>>` placeholders will be automatically filled based on the selected work and firm.
*   **For `Template Engine` Tab:** The `Template Engine` tab is designed for `{{}}` placeholders, which require manual input or special handling. It will *ignore* `[]` and `<<>>` placeholders, as those are handled by the `AutodocGen`'s direct database mapping.
