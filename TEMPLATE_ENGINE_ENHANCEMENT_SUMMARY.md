# Template Engine Enhancement Summary

## Task Completed: Enhanced Template Merge Engine with Two-Pass System

### Overview
Successfully enhanced the template merge engine to perform a two-pass placeholder replacement system as requested:

1. **Pass 1**: Replace work-level `[PLACEHOLDER]` tokens
2. **Pass 2**: Replace firm-level `<<PLACEHOLDER>>` tokens (supports both looping over firms and default firm selection)
3. **Pass 3**: Replace user input `{{placeholder}}` tokens (existing functionality)
4. **Fallback**: Unknown placeholders remain untouched for easier debugging

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Enhanced `template_processor.py`

**New Methods Added:**
- `_replace_placeholders_two_pass()` - Main orchestrator for the two-pass system
- `_replace_work_level_placeholders()` - Handles `[PLACEHOLDER]` tokens (Pass 1)
- `_replace_firm_level_placeholders()` - Handles `<<PLACEHOLDER>>` tokens (Pass 2)  
- `_replace_user_input_placeholders()` - Handles `{{placeholder}}` tokens (Pass 3)
- `_update_paragraph_text()` - Updates paragraph content while preserving structure
- `extract_all_placeholders()` - Enhanced placeholder extraction for debugging

**Enhanced Methods:**
- `replace_placeholders()` - Now uses the two-pass system
- `generate_letters_for_firms()` - Updated to use two-pass system with firm-specific data
- `extract_placeholders()` - Maintains backward compatibility while adding new functionality

#### 2. Integration with Work Data Provider

The enhanced system integrates seamlessly with the existing `WorkDataProvider` class:
- Uses `generate_placeholders()` method to get consolidated placeholder data
- Supports firm-specific data through `get_firm_document_data()`
- Maintains compatibility with existing database structure

#### 3. Comprehensive Placeholder Support

**Work-Level Placeholders (`[PLACEHOLDER]`):**
- `[WORK_NAME]`, `[CLIENT_NAME]`, `[CURRENT_DATE]`, `[CURRENT_TIME]`, etc.
- Populated from work database tables
- Processed first to establish document context

**Firm-Level Placeholders (`<<PLACEHOLDER>>`):**
- `<<FIRM_NAME>>`, `<<PG_AMOUNT>>`, `<<PG_NO>>`, `<<BANK_NAME>>`, etc.
- Populated from firm_documents table
- Support for multiple firms (loops over each firm when generating multi-firm documents)
- Falls back to default firm data when single document generation

**User Input Placeholders (`{{placeholder}}`):**
- Existing functionality preserved
- Processed last to allow user overrides
- Includes special handling for COST calculations and date formatting  

### Key Features

#### 1. **Debugging-Friendly Design**
- Unknown placeholders remain untouched in the final document
- Makes it easy to identify missing data or typos
- No silent failures - always clear what wasn't replaced

#### 2. **Firm-Specific Processing**
- When generating documents for multiple firms, each firm gets its own specific data
- Firm-level placeholders are updated with the current firm's information
- Supports the existing multi-firm document generation workflow

#### 3. **Backward Compatibility**
- All existing UI components continue to work without modification
- `extract_placeholders()` method maintains its original return format
- New `extract_all_placeholders()` method available for advanced use cases

#### 4. **Robust Error Handling**
- Graceful handling of missing data
- Case-insensitive fallbacks where appropriate
- Preserves original placeholder format when replacement value is empty

### Testing and Verification

Created comprehensive tests to verify:
- ✅ Work-level placeholder replacement (Pass 1)
- ✅ Firm-level placeholder replacement (Pass 2)  
- ✅ User input placeholder replacement (Pass 3)
- ✅ Unknown placeholders remain untouched for debugging
- ✅ Regex patterns correctly identify all placeholder types
- ✅ Processing order is maintained correctly

### Documentation Updates

Updated `prompts/TEMPLATE_ENGINE.md` with:
- Clear explanation of the three placeholder types
- Processing order documentation
- Examples of each placeholder type
- Debugging features explanation

### Impact and Benefits

1. **Enhanced Functionality**: Support for automatic work and firm data population
2. **Better Organization**: Clear separation between different data types
3. **Improved Debugging**: Unknown placeholders remain visible for troubleshooting
4. **Maintained Compatibility**: Existing templates and UI continue to work
5. **Scalable Design**: Easy to add new placeholder types in the future

### Usage Examples

**Template Content:**
```
Project: [WORK_NAME]
Client: [CLIENT_NAME]
Firm: <<FIRM_NAME>>
PG Amount: <<PG_AMOUNT>>
Custom Field: {{user_input}}
```

**After Processing:**
```
Project: Highway Construction Project  
Client: State Highway Department
Firm: Elite Builders Ltd
PG Amount: ₹ 50,00,000.00
Custom Field: User provided value
```

### Conclusion

The enhanced template merge engine successfully implements the requested two-pass system while maintaining full backward compatibility. The solution provides robust placeholder replacement with excellent debugging capabilities and supports the existing firm-specific document generation workflows.
