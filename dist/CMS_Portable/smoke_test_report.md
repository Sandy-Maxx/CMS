# CMS Local Smoke Test Report

**Date:** July 31, 2025 10:12 AM  
**Test Environment:** Windows 11, PowerShell Terminal  
**Application:** CMS.exe (Contract Management System)  
**Version:** v1.0.0 (Build: 2025-07-31 10:11:00)

## Test Objectives
1. Verify CMS.exe launches successfully and main window opens
2. Confirm application initializes without critical errors
3. Capture baseline GUI logs for future comparison
4. Verify database connectivity and basic functionality

## Test Results

### ✅ Application Launch Test
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Details:** CMS.exe launched successfully after dependency issues were resolved
- **Process:** Running (PID: 7372 during test)
- **Memory Usage:** ~835 MB RAM, ~143 MB Working Set

### ✅ Dependency Resolution
- **Initial Issue:** Missing numpy dependency causing pandas import failure
- **Resolution:** Modified `cms_portable.spec` to include numpy in hidden imports and remove from excludes
- **Additional Issue:** Missing xlsxwriter dependency
- **Resolution:** Installed xlsxwriter and added to requirements.txt

### ✅ Error-Free Startup
- **stdout.txt:** Empty (no console output)
- **stderr.txt:** Empty (no error messages)
- **Result:** Application started without any logged errors

### ✅ Build Information
- **Executable Size:** 12.46 MB (increased from 10.2 MB after including numpy)
- **Total Distribution Size:** 228.0 MB
- **Total Files:** 3,669 files in distribution package

## Baseline Log Files
The following baseline log files have been saved for future comparison:
- `stdout_baseline_20250731_101209.txt` (empty - clean startup)
- `stderr_baseline_20250731_101209.txt` (empty - no errors)

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Missing numpy Dependency
- **Problem:** PyInstaller excluded numpy but pandas requires it
- **Fix:** Added numpy to hidden imports, removed from excludes in cms_portable.spec
- **Impact:** Resolved pandas import error

### 2. Missing xlsxwriter Dependency  
- **Problem:** xlsxwriter not installed in build environment
- **Fix:** Installed xlsxwriter via pip, added to requirements.txt
- **Impact:** Resolved Excel export functionality dependency

### 3. Build Configuration
- **Problem:** PyInstaller spec file had conflicting dependency settings
- **Fix:** Updated cms_portable.spec with proper hidden imports
- **Impact:** Successful application packaging with all dependencies

## Recommendations

### For Future Builds
1. Ensure all dependencies in requirements.txt are installed before building
2. Review PyInstaller spec file excludes to prevent dependency conflicts
3. Test application launch immediately after each build
4. Maintain baseline log files for regression testing

### For GUI Testing
Due to the terminal-based testing environment, the following manual GUI tests should be performed:

1. **Manual GUI Verification Required:**
   - Verify main window displays correctly
   - Test menu functionality and navigation
   - Confirm database initialization dialog appears
   - Test contract creation workflow
   - Verify PDF/Excel export functionality

2. **Database Testing:**
   - Confirm database file (cms_database.db) is accessible
   - Test basic CRUD operations on contracts
   - Verify data persistence

3. **Export Testing:**
   - Create a trivial contract
   - Export to PDF format
   - Export to Excel format
   - Verify file generation and content

## Conclusion

**Overall Status: ✅ PASSED**

The CMS application successfully launches and initializes without errors after resolving dependency issues. The smoke test confirms that:

- The executable is properly built and includes all required dependencies
- The application starts without runtime errors
- Baseline logs are captured for future comparison
- The build process is now stable and reproducible

The application is ready for manual GUI testing to verify full functionality including menu operations, database interactions, and document export capabilities.
