now new report. make sure to write modular scalable clean, readable reusable code considering maintainability, separation of concerns and easy debugging.
now add new variation with price logic. add separate module in features for this report. this is similar to the variation report but there is price reduction logic as follows:
1. if the quantity increases upto 125% of original qty then the total cost is calculated at the same unit rate.
2. if qty is increased from 125% to 140% then the cost of qty above 125% will be  @ 98% of the unit rate.
3. for qty from 140 to 150% total cost calculated @96% of unit rate. now the columns quantity (horizontally merged to 4 cells) under it subheads viz. before variation, after variation, quantity upto 125%, upto 140%, upto 150% rest of the column will adjust accordingly and at bottom after summery rows there will be percentage variation in overall cost.
