TEMPLATE ENGINE IS OK BUT THE AUTO REPORT GENETRATION IN D:\CMS\CMS\features\AutodocGen IS HAVING THIS :
IN THE EXE THE IN THE TEMPLATE WITH MANY  [] WRAPPED PLACEHOLDERS THE OUTPUT IS REPLACING ONLY ONE PLACEHOLDER. IT SHOULD REPLACE   │
│    ALL THE PLACEHOLDERS IN HEADER, FOOTER, PARAGRAPHS, TABLE ETC. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES A PLACEHOLDER GETS REPEATD EVERY INSTANSE MUST BE POPULATED WITH DYNAMIC DATA. IF THERE IS SOME PLACEHOLDER WHOSE VALUE IS NOT AVAILABLE THEN JUST LEAVE THAT PLACEHOLDER AS IT IS.
